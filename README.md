This project entails incorporating a simple user interface created using Flask, which acts as a 
smooth entry point for users to engage with the AI capabilities of the chatbot. 
Numerous Python libraries, such as: 
- NLTK for natural language processing,
- TensorFlow for machine learning,
- SpaCy for linguistic tasks,
- Gunicorn for web server deployment,
- NumPy for numerical computations,
- and JSON for dataset management,
are used in this project. With the help of the dataset's diverse conversational patterns, the chatbot may fully understand user queries. 
This study shows how several Python tools may work together to produce a comprehensive solution and exemplifies the integration of web development, AI, and interface design.
